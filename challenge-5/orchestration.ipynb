    "- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed progress tracking and status updates\n",
    "- **Timeout Management**: 5-minute timeout for orchestration completion\n",
    "- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of individual agent failures\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Use Case Example\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook includes a practical example demonstrating the orchestration of claim analysis for \"CL002\", showing how the system processes claim details and retrieves additional data to provide comprehensive multi-agent analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation represents a cutting-edge approach to insurance claim processing, leveraging the power of concurrent AI agents to provide thorough, multi-perspective analysis that would traditionally require multiple human experts working in sequence.\n"

      "Conclusion:\n",
      "Based solely on the policy language, the LIAB-AUTO-001 clearly covers liability for bodily injury and property damage to others up to specified limits but excludes any damage to the insured's own vehicle or personal injuries. It also excludes certain uses and intentional acts. Therefore, any claim for liability to third parties within limits and circumstances not excluded by this policy would be covered.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the claim involves the insured's own vehicle damage, injuries to the insured, or exclusions described above (e.g., racing, commercial use), the claim would not be covered.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hence, approval of credit should depend on whether the claim aligns with covered liabilities under this policy. The policy language decisively limits coverage to third-party liability and excludes own damage or non-covered usages, guiding a coverage determination accordingly.\n",

      "Analysis:\n",
      "- Claim Details: The claim CL001 involves vehicle damage to a 2004 Honda Accord, which was legally parked when struck by another vehicle. The incident date is July 17, 2025. The damage description is extensive, including front bumper detachment, severe denting on the driver side front quarter panel, wheel/tire damage, paint transfer, and possible hidden mechanical damage.\n",
      "- Documentation: The claim includes photos of the vehicle damage, police report (Springfield Police Dept., report number 25-52814), and a repair estimate from Springfield Auto Body. The claimant provided a witness contact with statements supporting the incident circumstances.\n",
      "- Damage Assessment & Cost Estimates: The visible damage includes major front-end structural and cosmetic damage, which is consistent with the description and photos provided. The use of a reputable repair shop and detailed damage description add credence. However, the actual repair estimate and costs have not been detailed in the retrieved data.\n",
      "- Policy Coverage: No policy documents for \"LIAB-AUTO-001\" were found in the database to validate coverage clauses, limits, or exclusions. This is a critical gap in confirming whether the requested repairs are covered under the policy.\n",
      "- Potential Red Flags: The claimant has a secondary recent crash dated July 19, 2025, on a different vehicle and policy, which is unrelated here but worth noting for claim history. Incident timing and details appear consistent with no evident contradiction or suspicious elements.\n",
      "\n",
      "Missing Info / Concerns:\n",
      "1. Repair cost estimate details and breakdown not retrieved, limiting validation of cost reasonableness.\n",
      "2. No policy documents or coverage details found for \"LIAB-AUTO-001\" to confirm coverage, deductible, or exclusions.\n",
      "3. Confirmation of repair shop estimate authenticity and completeness is pending.\n",
      "4. No direct mechanic or adjuster damage report for hidden damage or mechanical impact assessments.\n",
      "5. Lack of witness statement content beyond contact information provided.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next Steps:\n",
      "1. Retrieve or request the official repair estimate document with a detailed cost breakdown.\n",
      "2. Locate and review the insurance policy document for policy number \"LIAB-AUTO-001\" to verify coverage terms and exclusions.\n",
      "3. Obtain official mechanic or adjuster damage assessment for mechanical and structural damage verification.\n",
      "4. Contact witness Melissa Grant for a formal written statement and verification.\n",
      "5. Confirm claimant's deductible and verify if repair estimates minus deductible compliance is met.\n",
      "6. Pending complete documentation and policy confirmation, consider an on-site vehicle inspection for damage validation.\n",
